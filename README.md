# Ivy-league-admission-prediction
This project estimates the probability of student admission to Ivy League College based on factors such as GRE, TOEFL, SOP, LOR, and CGPA. It helps applicants understand their admission chances and make informed decisions during the application process.

## Project Overview
This project estimates the probability of student admission to Ivy League College based on factors such as GRE, TOEFL, SOP, LOR, and CGPA.It helps applicants understand their admission chances and make informed decisions during the application process.

## Features Used
- GRE Score 
- TOEFL Score          
- University Rating    
- SOP                  
- LOR                  
- CGPA                 
- Research             
- Chance of Admit
## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Linear Regression
## Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (correlation heatmap, distribution plots)
- Pre-Processing  (Handle Null values, Duplicates, Missing values)
- Feature engineering (normalization, outlier treatment)
- Model Building (Linear Regression, Ridge)
- Model evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R² -Score )
## Conclusion
Linear Regression model was developed on the Jamboree Admission dataset to predict students admission chances.
The initial model achieved an R² score of 82%.
To improve model stability and reduce multicollinearity, Ridge regularization was applied, resulting in an R² score of 80.5%.
Since the difference is minimal, the original model performance of 82% is considered as the final reported result.
The model achieved an R² score of 82%, indicating strong predictive performance in estimating admission chances.
